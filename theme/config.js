Navigate to the repository\n2. run `GITHUB_TOKEN=[your token] npx landr deploy`\n3. Landr will push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch.\n\n> We encourage using `npx` as opposed to installing landr globally. `npx` comes bundled with NPM version 5.2+. More info can be found [here](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).\n\n## Alternatively using Landr as a dependency\n\n1. Install landr\n\n`npm install landr`\n\n2. Add the following to the script entry in the project's `package.json` file\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"landr\": \"landr deploy\",\n    \"landr-preview\": \"landr preview\"\n  }\n```\n\n3. Run the CLI\n`GITHUB_TOKEN=[your token] npm run landr`\n\n4. Landr will push the generated files to the `gh-pages` branch.\n\n## Commands\n\nLandr exposes two commands\n\n1. `deploy` - Generates the artifacts and pushes to Github pages\n2. `preview` - Generates the artifacts and starts a local server\n\n## Under the Hood\n\n1.  Landr will scan the repo utilizing [Scrutinizer](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/scrutinizer).\n\n2.  Then it will persist the data, and pass it over to [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) which will produce a single page website. For styling, we\\'ll use our very own [Rendition](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/rendition).\n","name":"landr","public":true,"fork":false,"description":"source code = website üè†","dependencies":["capitano","chalk","gh-pages","gitinfo","scrutinizer","shelljs"],"lastCommitDate":"2019-06-24T17:16:46Z","latestRelease":{"tagName":"v3.0.1","asssets":[]},"latestPreRelease":null,"githubUrl":"https://github.com/resin-io/landr"}
