Why is Landr using Netlify instead of GitHub Pages?
---------------------------------------------------

Netlify can do everything that GitHub Pages can, and it also provides some
extra features and flexibility that we find really valuable, such as being able
to deploy more than one branch of a site at the same time, and to A/B testing
with them, manage form submissions, and more. On top all of that, Netlify is
free to use!
