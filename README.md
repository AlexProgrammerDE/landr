## Installation

```
npm install landr -g
```

```
landr dev -p 3000
```

Visit `localhost:3000`.

## Features

* Simple to use - install and deploy!
* Control - extendable

## How it Works

Landr leverages webpack, we have custom loaders that load conventional git files like a `README`. From there we have the data as js object and can easily load it into some templates and build your site. Which updates whenever you update you're repo.

## Why landr

You have to maintain your source code why maintain a website too?

As a software company we have a growing number of websites to build and maintain. We built landr so we could focus on our projects and not their websites.
