## Features

* Simple to use - install and deploy!
* Control - extendable

## How it Works

Landr leverages webpack, we have custom loaders that load conventional source files like a `README` consumable data. We can load it into templates and build your site, therefore updating as your repository updates.

## Why landr

You have to maintain your source code why maintain a website too?

As a software company we have a growing number of websites to build and maintain. We built landr so we could focus on our projects and not their websites.
