Contributing to Landr
=====================

We're happy you're interested in Landr! Make sure to take a look at the
[architecture
document](https://github.com/jviotti/landr/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md), which
describes how Landr works.

The main areas we would love to get your with are:

- Extending Landr to understand more open source conventions

Have you seen open source projects adopting a new convention that would allow
us to understand the project better and produce better websites? Let us know,
or even better: make Landr understand them!

- Making Landr sites look good no matter what information is available

Each project is unique, and the parts that Landr can infer out of the box
change depending on the project. We want to consider all these combinations and
create adaptative websites no matter what subset of information we have.

The best way to test this is by attempting to run Landr on any of your
projects, and checking if the results are not satisfactory.
